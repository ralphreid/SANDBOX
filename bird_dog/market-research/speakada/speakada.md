WHAT ITALIAN WORDS
SHOULD I LEARN & WHY?
If you’re a beginner Italian learner, then you should first
learn words that give you the highest yield for your time and e!ort. This means that you should learn Italian words according to word frequency. “Word frequency” refers to how frequent or how often a given word is used in a certain language. We believe that this the most e"cient way to learn Italian vocabulary.
In the Italian language alone, there are already tens of thousands of individual words that you could potentially learn. This is very overwhelming! According to Grande Dizionario Hoepli Italiano \(2015\), there are at least 500,000 Italian words that you could learn. But when we analyze the frequency of each of those words in speech, books and other media, we realize that not every word has the same value for learning.
Just think about how you use your own native language. You only use a small amount of available words in your daily life. On the other hand, you ignore the majority of words that are in the dictionary. In fact, you may not even use or know thousands of words in the dictionary of your own native language. For example, if you’re an English native speaker, you’ve probably never heard of the words “kakorrhaphiophobia”, “ulotrichous” or “impignorate”, but these are English words found in many English dictionaries.
The principle of “word frequency” applies the same to the Italian language, too. Therefore, as a Italian beginner, you’ll want to learn words that appear most frequently in day-to- day use by native Italian speakers. Paul Nation, a world- renowned vocabulary acquisition linguist researcher from Victoria University of Wellington, emphasizes the need to use word frequency lists as guidelines to study vocabulary in a foreign language. If you learn about 2000 most frequently used words in a foreign language, then you’ll be able to understand 90% of the language as it is spoken in normal life, according to research.
In addition, Linguist James Milton from Swansea University found that if you learn about 2000 words, you are likely to pass the A2-level CEFR language exam. The CEFR refers to the Common European Framework Reference for Languages, and passing the A2 level means that you will pass beginner Italian, to get you comfortably into the intermediate levels of Italian.
HOW DO I LEARN THE MOST COMMON ITALIAN
VOCABULARY?
If you’re a Italian beginner, and you want to pass the A2
CEFR level and get 90% comprehension, then you’ll need to learn Italian vocabulary according to word frequency. This is a good idea, but you probably want a clear plan for how to actually do it.
So, we made is easier for you by breaking down Italian vocab learning into 3 stages for beginners. First, learn words using picture-based flashcards. Secondly, learn words using sentence-based flashcards. Thirdly, learn the most common Italian phrases. All 3 stages will help build your Italian vocabulary step-by-step.
1\. Learning Words with Picture-Based Flashcards
The first step is for you to learn the most common Italian words \(verbs, nouns and adjectives\) that can be easily visualized with an image. We suggest starting with picture- based words because you’ll find that it’s a fast and even fun way to learn the easiest Italian words. Learning picture- based words allows you to tap into your visual long term memory, too.
A research study from MIT \(Massachusetts Institute of Technology\) found that long-term memory is capable of storing a massive number of objects with details from the image. Participants were shown pictures of 2,500 objects over the course of 5.5 hours. It was found that participants were able to successfully maintain detailed representations of thousands of images in their memory. If you apply the same idea to learning Italian vocab, then you can focus first on learning the most frequent words that can be easily learned using an image.
In addition, you no longer rely on English language translations of the words. This is beneficial because you build stronger connections between the new Italian word and the actual concept of the thing. You skip English translations altogether so that you can think faster in Italian only.
Our Italian 625 Words Flashcards are all picture-based Italian words that take advantage of the benefits mentioned above.

2\. Learning Words with Sentence-based Flashcards
The next stage of learning Italian vocabulary is to learn sentence-based words using the context of example sentences and monolingual definitions. In order to be able to speak and understand Italian, you will need to learn the 2000 most common Italian words, including abstract words, that cannot be visualized. Therefore learning using images only would no longer be as e!ective. You need to start creating meaning in your own mind by understanding Italian direct from sentences.
As you become familiar with Italian words, you want to start to transition into Italian-only content. We do this by using the idea of “chunks”. Linguist Michael Lewis emphasized that if you want to learn a language, then you need to understand sentence “chunks” of the language. It’s not enough to learn words on their own.

BUNDLE
While the linguist Stephen Krashen put forward the “input
hypothesis”. Krashen states that learners progress in their knowledge of the language when they understand language input that is slightly more advanced than their current level. That is why you should focus on acquiring new Italian words step-by-step in the context of real Italian sentences and basic Italian monolingual definitions.
Our Italian 2000 Words Flashcards are all sentence-based with monolingual definitions that take advantage of the benefits mentioned above. The Italian sentences only include words that are found in the 625 words deck and the 2000 words deck.
This means that you will learn from Italian “chunks” and gradually build upon your vocab knowledge with each new flashcard.
3\. Learning Common Italian Phrases
After learning the 2000 most frequent words, you are estimated to reach the Italian A2 CEFR level, along with 90% comprehension of texts. You will be able to understand Italian but may still find it di"cult to produce Italian sentences to communicate with Italian speakers in common, everyday contexts.
Being able to put the words together to form sentences quickly in di!erent situations may not come naturally, particularly if you have not learned Italian grammar. This is why the next logical step is to learn the most common Italian phrases. If you learn the most common Italian phrases, this will allow you to transition to grammar easily and build your confidence when speaking in Italian.
Linguist Paul Nation found that, similar to his research on the most frequently used words in a language, there are also frequently used phrases in languages. If you learned these common Italian phrases, then it would be very helpful in real life situations. For example, you could use these phrases when speaking to native Italian speakers on the phone, via email, or when meeting them for the first time. The phrases are useful when visiting a Italian- speaking country and you want to speak to a native speaker at the airport, taxi and other transport, hotel, restaurant, shops, tourist spots and more!
Our Common Italian Phrases Flashcards are based on linguist Paul Nation’s research, along with our own improvements. It includes the top 100 Italian phrases that you can use in a variety of contexts so you can speak with confidence abroad, get what you want and express yourself clearly. It will also help you avoid awkward and embarrassing situations with native speakers because you’ll know what to say.
