"""A module containing unit tests for the time_to_close module.

This module contains unit tests for the measure_time_to_close and
get_average_time_to_close functions in the time_to_close module.
The tests use mock GitHub issues to test the functions' behavior.

Classes:
    TestMeasureTimeToClose: A class to test the measure_time_to_close function.
    TestGetAverageTimeToClose: A class to test the get_average_time_to_close function.
