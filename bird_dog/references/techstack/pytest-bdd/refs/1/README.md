# PyTest-BDD Examples

This repository contains examples of using PyTest-BDD, a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for writing tests in Python using the pytest testing framework.

## Files

- `calculator.py`: Contains the Calculator class used in the PyTest-BDD Features Example.
- `test_calculator.py`: Contains the PyTest-BDD Features Example.
- `test_shopping_cart.py`: Contains the PyTest-BDD Scenario Outline Example.
- `hooks.py`: Contains the PyTest-BDD Hooks Example.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you will need to have pytest and pytest-bdd installed. You can install them with pip:

```
pip install pytest pytest-bdd
```

Then, you can run the tests with the following command:

```
pytest
```

## Further Recommendations

- Make sure to write comprehensive test cases that cover all possible scenarios.
- Use pytest-bdd's tagging feature to categorize and selectively run tests.
- Use pytest-bdd's hooks to perform setup and teardown actions for your tests.
- Use pytest's reporting capabilities to generate detailed test reports.
