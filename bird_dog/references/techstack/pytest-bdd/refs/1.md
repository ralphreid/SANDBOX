# PyTest — BDD (Behavioural Driven Development)

![Ramkumar R][1]

Pytest BDD is a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for writing tests in Python using the pytest testing framework. It combines the simplicity and power of the pytest framework with the expressive syntax of the Gherkin language used in BDD.

pytest-bdd is a pytest plugin that allows you to write behavior-driven development (BDD) style tests using the Gherkin syntax. Here are some **key points** and rules to keep in mind when using pytest-bdd:

1. **Gherkin Syntax:** pytest-bdd uses the Gherkin syntax to define scenarios and steps. Gherkin is a structured language for describing software behaviors using keywords like Given, When, Then, And, and But. The syntax is as follows:

   Feature: Descriptive text of the feature

   Scenario: Descriptive text of the scenario
   Given some initial condition
   When some action is performed
   Then some expected outcome is observed

Step Definitions: Steps in Gherkin scenarios need to be implemented as functions in Python. pytest-bdd matches the steps in feature files with corresponding step definitions. You can define step functions using the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator or as regular Python functions.

1. **Fixtures:** pytest-bdd integrates with pytest’s fixture system. You can define fixtures to set up and tear down the state for your BDD tests. Fixtures can be shared across multiple scenarios or specific to a single scenario.
2. **Test Execution:** pytest-bdd treats each scenario as an individual test case. You can run the BDD tests with the regular pytest command: `pytest`.
3. **Scenario Outlines:** Scenario Outlines allow you to define a scenario template with placeholder values. This allows you to generate multiple concrete scenarios by providing different sets of values. You can use the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator to parametrize the steps in Scenario Outlines.
4. **Tags:** pytest-bdd supports tagging scenarios and features using the `@pytest.mark` decorator. This allows you to selectively run tests based on tags, providing greater control over test execution.
5. **Hooks:** pytest-bdd provides hooks that allow you to execute code before or after certain events in the BDD test lifecycle. For example, you can use hooks to set up test data or perform cleanup tasks.
6. **Reporting:** pytest-bdd integrates seamlessly with pytest’s reporting capabilities. You can use various pytest plugins or reporting tools to generate detailed test reports and summaries.

**PyTest-BDD Simple Example:**

    from pytest_bdd import scenario, given, when, then

    @scenario('calculator.feature', 'Addition')
    def test_addition():
    pass

    @given("I have two numbers")
    def step_given_numbers():
    number1 = 5
    number2 = 3
    return number1, number2

    @when("I add the numbers")
    def step_when_add_numbers(step_given_numbers):
    number1, number2 = step_given_numbers
    result = number1 + number2
    return result

    @then("I should get the sum")
    def step_then_sum(step_when_add_numbers):
    assert step_when_add_numbers == 8

In this example, we have a single scenario defined using the `@scenario` decorator. The scenario is associated with a feature file (`calculator.feature`) and a scenario outline (`Addition`).

The scenario consists of three steps: `step_given_numbers`, `step_when_add_numbers`, and `step_then_sum`. Each step is defined using the `@given`, `@when`, and `@then` decorators, respectively.

In the `step_given_numbers` step, we simply define two numbers (5 and 3) as local variables and return them as a tuple.

The `step_when_add_numbers` step takes the numbers from the previous step as an argument (`step_given_numbers`). It adds the numbers and returns the result.

The `step_then_sum` step takes the result from the previous step (`step_when_add_numbers`) as an argument and asserts that it is equal to 8.

**PyTest-BDD Features Example:**

    import pytest
    from pytest_bdd import given, when, then, scenarios, parsers

    # Define the scenario(s)
    scenarios('calculator.feature')

    # Fixture for the calculator
    @pytest.fixture
    def calculator():
    return Calculator()  # Assuming Calculator is a class that represents the calculator

    # Step definitions
    @given('I have entered\<number\> into the calculator')
    def enter_number(calculator, number):
    calculator.enter_number(number)

    @when('I press add')
    def press_add(calculator):
    calculator.press_add()

    @when(parsers.parse('I press multiply with {number:d}'))
    def press_multiply(calculator, number):
    calculator.press_multiply(number)

    @then('the result should be\<result\> on the screen')
    def check_result(calculator, result):
    assert calculator.get_result() == result

In the above code, we have a feature file named `calculator.feature` that contains one or more scenarios. Each step in the scenarios is defined as a separate function using the `@given`, `@when`, and `@then` decorators provided by pytest-bdd.

The `calculator` fixture is defined using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator. This fixture sets up the calculator object before each scenario and makes it available to the step functions.

The step functions interact with the calculator object based on the Gherkin steps defined in the feature file. The `calculator` fixture is passed as an argument to the step functions, allowing them to access and manipulate the calculator object.

You can run these tests using the regular pytest command: `pytest`. pytest-bdd will automatically match the steps in the feature file with the corresponding step functions and execute the scenarios.

**PyTest-BDD Scenario Outline Example:**

We have a feature file named `shopping_cart.feature` with the following content:

    Feature: Shopping Cart
    As a customer
    I want to add products to my shopping cart
    So that I can purchase them later

    Scenario Outline: Add products to the shopping cart
    Given I have an empty shopping cart
    When I add\<product\> to the cart
    Then the cart should contain \<product\>

    Examples:
    | product  |
    | Apples   |
    | Bananas  |
    | Oranges  |

In the above scenario outline, we have a generic scenario that can be executed with multiple sets of values provided by the Examples section.

To implement the steps, create a file named `test_shopping_cart.py` with the following code:

    import pytest

    @pytest.fixture
    def shopping_cart():
    return []

    @given("I have an empty shopping cart")
    def empty_shopping_cart(shopping_cart):
    assert len(shopping_cart) == 0

    @when("I add\<product\> to the cart")
    def add_product(shopping_cart, product):
    shopping_cart.append(product)

    @then("the cart should contain\<product\>")
    def verify_cart_contents(shopping_cart, product):
    assert product in shopping_cart

In the code above, we define a fixture `shopping_cart` that returns an empty list representing the shopping cart. We also define step functions using pytest-bdd decorators (`@given`, `@when`, `@then`). The `shopping_cart` fixture is used to share the state across steps.

Now, if you run the tests with the regular pytest command (`pytest`), you should see the following output:

    ========================= test session starts =========================
    ...

    Scenario Outline: Add products to the shopping cart -- Examples: Apples
    Given I have an empty shopping cart
    When I add Apples to the cart
    Then the cart should contain Apples
    PASSED

    Scenario Outline: Add products to the shopping cart -- Examples: Bananas
    Given I have an empty shopping cart
    When I add Bananas to the cart
    Then the cart should contain Bananas
    PASSED

    Scenario Outline: Add products to the shopping cart -- Examples: Oranges
    Given I have an empty shopping cart
    When I add Oranges to the cart
    Then the cart should contain Oranges
    PASSED

    ...

    ========================= X passed, Y warnings in Z seconds ========================

In the output, you can see that the scenario outline is executed for each set of values provided in the Examples section. Each scenario passes, indicating that the shopping cart is updated correctly with the specified products.

By using scenario outlines and Examples, you can easily generate multiple scenarios from a template and test different cases with varying inputs, making your BDD tests more flexible and reusable.

**PyTest-BDD Hooks Example:**

pytest-bdd provides several hooks that allow you to execute code before or after certain events in the BDD test lifecycle. These hooks enable you to set up test data, perform cleanup tasks, or customize the behavior of pytest-bdd. Here are some commonly used hooks:

`1\. pytest_bdd_before_scenario(request, feature, scenario)`: This hook is called before each scenario. You can use it to perform setup actions specific to each scenario.

    @pytest.hookimpl
    def pytest_bdd_before_scenario(request, feature, scenario):
    print("Before scenario:", scenario.name)
    # Perform setup actions
    # Access scenario-specific information via the 'scenario' argument

    Output:

    Before scenario: Scenario 1
    Before scenario: Scenario 2

`2\. pytest_bdd_after_scenario(request, feature, scenario, result)`: This hook is called after each scenario. It allows you to perform cleanup or teardown actions specific to each scenario.

    @pytest.hookimpl
    def pytest_bdd_after_scenario(request, feature, scenario, result):
    print("After scenario:", scenario.name)
    # Perform cleanup actions
    # Access scenario-specific information via the 'scenario' argument

    Output:

    After scenario: Scenario 1
    After scenario: Scenario 2

`3\. pytest_bdd_before_step(request, feature, scenario, step, step_func)`: This hook is called before each step in a scenario. It can be used to perform actions specific to each step, such as logging or additional setup.

    @pytest.hookimpl
    def pytest_bdd_before_step(request, feature, scenario, step, step_func):
    print("Before step:", step.name)
    # Perform actions specific to each step
    # Access step-specific information via the 'step' argument

    Output:

    Before step: Given some initial condition
    Before step: When some action is performed
    Before step: Then some expected outcome is observed

`4\. pytest_bdd_after_step(request, feature, scenario, step, step_func, step_func_args)`: This hook is called after each step in a scenario. It allows you to perform actions specific to each step, such as logging or cleanup.

    @pytest.hookimpl
    def pytest_bdd_after_step(request, feature, scenario, step, step_func, step_func_args):
    print("After step:", step.name)
    # Perform actions specific to each step
    # Access step-specific information via the 'step' argument

    Output:

    After step: Given some initial condition
    After step: When some action is performed
    After step: Then some expected outcome is observed

These are just a few examples of pytest-bdd hooks. There are more hooks available that allow you to customize various stages of the BDD test lifecycle. By implementing these hooks, you can execute custom code before or after specific events, enabling you to integrate additional functionality or perform necessary actions for your BDD tests.

**PyTest-BDD Reporting :**

pytest-bdd integrates with pytest’s reporting capabilities, allowing you to use various plugins or tools to generate detailed test reports and summaries. Here are a few examples of reporting options you can use with pytest-bdd:

1. pytest-html: pytest-html is a plugin that generates an HTML report for your test suite. It provides a comprehensive view of your pytest-bdd tests, including overall test status, detailed test results, and embedded screenshots (if available).

To generate an HTML report, install the `pytest-html` plugin using pip:

    pip install pytest-html

Then, run your pytest-bdd tests with the `\--html` option to specify the output file:

    pytest --html=report.html

After running the tests, a report.html file will be generated in the current directory, containing the pytest-bdd test results in an HTML format.

1. pytest-allure: pytest-allure is another popular plugin for generating rich and interactive test reports using the Allure framework. Allure reports provide detailed test execution information, including test steps, attachments, and statistics.

To use pytest-allure, install the `pytest-allure-adaptor` plugin:

    pip install pytest-allure-adaptor

Then, run your pytest-bdd tests with the `\--alluredir` option to specify the output directory:

    pytest --alluredir=report_dir

After running the tests, a report_dir directory will be created, containing the Allure report files. You can then generate and view the report using the Allure command-line tool or a compatible reporting server.

1. pytest-cucumberjson: pytest-cucumberjson is a plugin that generates Cucumber-style JSON reports for your pytest-bdd tests. These reports can be consumed by various tools for further analysis or integration with other systems.

To use pytest-cucumberjson, install the `pytest-cucumberjson` plugin:

    pip install pytest-cucumberjson

Then, run your pytest-bdd tests with the `\--cucumberjson` option to specify the output file:

    pytest --cucumberjson=report.json

After running the tests, a report.json file will be generated in the current directory, containing the pytest-bdd test results in the Cucumber JSON format.

These are just a few examples of pytest plugins you can use to generate test reports with pytest-bdd. Each plugin offers its own set of features and customization options. You can explore their respective documentation for more information on advanced configurations and report styling.

**PyTest-BDD Tags Example:**

pytest-bdd allows you to use tags to selectively run subsets of your BDD scenarios or features. Tags provide a flexible way to categorize and filter tests based on specific criteria. Here are some examples of how to use tags with pytest-bdd and the expected output:

1. **Tagging Features:**

   # feature.feature

   @smoke
   Feature: Login

   Scenario: Successful login
   Given the user is on the login page
   When they enter valid credentials
   Then they should be redirected to the home page

   Scenario: Failed login
   Given the user is on the login page
   When they enter invalid credentials
   Then they should see an error message

Running only the scenarios with the `@smoke` tag:

    pytest --bdd --tags=smoke

    Output:

    feature.feature::Login::Successful login
    feature.feature::Login::Failed login

2\. **Tagging Scenarios:**

    # feature.feature
    Feature: Search

    @regression
    Scenario: Basic search
    Given the user is on the search page
    When they enter a search query
    Then they should see search results

    Scenario: Advanced search
    Given the user is on the search page
    When they perform an advanced search
    Then they should see refined search results

Running only the scenarios with the `@regression` tag:

    pytest --bdd --tags=regression

    Output:

    feature.feature::Search::Basic search

3\. **Tagging Scenarios with Multiple Tags:**

    # feature.feature
    Feature: Checkout

    @smoke @regression
    Scenario: Adding items to cart
    Given the user is on the product page
    When they add items to the cart
    Then they should see the items in the cart

    @regression
    Scenario: Removing items from cart
    Given the user is on the cart page
    When they remove items from the cart
    Then the cart should be empty

Running only the scenarios with both the `@smoke` and `@regression` tags:

    pytest --bdd --tags=smoke+regression

    Output:

    feature.feature::Checkout::Adding items to cart

4\. **Excluding Scenarios with Tags:**

    # feature.feature
    Feature: Checkout

    @smoke
    Scenario: Adding items to cart
    Given the user is on the product page
    When they add items to the cart
    Then they should see the items in the cart

    @regression
    Scenario: Removing items from cart
    Given the user is on the cart page
    When they remove items from the cart
    Then the cart should be empty

Running all scenarios except those with the `@smoke` tag:

    pytest --bdd --tags=-smoke

    Output:

    feature.feature::Checkout::Removing items from cart

These examples demonstrate how you can use tags to selectively run subsets of scenarios or features using pytest-bdd. By leveraging tags, you can easily organize and execute tests based on specific criteria such as priority, category, or test type.
