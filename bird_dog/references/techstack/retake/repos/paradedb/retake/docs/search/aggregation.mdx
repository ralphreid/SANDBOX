title: Aggregation
---

Aggregation, also known as faceting, enables developers to gather statistics about search results,
enabling the analysis of patterns in the dataset at scale.

### Basic Usage

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from retakesearch import A

bucket_name = "average_price"
agg = A("avg", field="price")

response = index.search(
    Search().aggs.metrics(bucket_name, agg)
)

# Print the average price
print(response.aggregations[bucket_name].value)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { avgAggregation } from "retake-search/helpers"

bucketName = "average_price"

response = index.search(Search().avgAggregation(bucket_name, "price"))

// Print the average price
print(response.aggregations[bucket_name].value)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Operators

### Distinct Values

`terms` groups results by distinct values. Each unique value becomes a bucket.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Search().aggs.metrics(bucket_name, A("terms", field="color"))
```

```typescript Typescript
import { termsAggregation } from "retake-search/helpers"

Search().termsAggregation(bucketName, "color")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Range

`range` groups results into range buckets. For numerical data, these ranges could be something like
"1-10", "10-20", "20-30", etc.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Search().aggs.metrics(
    bucket_name,
    A('range', field='price', ranges=[{'from': 10, 'to': 20}, {'from': 20, 'to': 30}])
)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { rangeAggregation } from "retake-search/helpers"

Search()
  .rangeAggregation(bucketName, "price")
  .ranges([
    { from: 10, to: 20 },
    { from: 20, to: 30 },
  ])
```

</CodeGroup>

### Date Range

`date_range` functions similarly to `range` but works with date fields.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Search().aggs.metrics(
    bucket_name,
    A("date_range", field="publish_date", ranges=[{"from": "now-1d/d", "to": "now/d"}, {"from": "now-1M/M", "to": "now/M"}])
)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { dateRangeAggregation } from "retake-search/aggregations"

Search()
  .dateRangeAggregation(bucket_name, "publish_date")
  .ranges([
    { from: "now-1d/d", to: "now/d" },
    { from: "now-1M/M", to: "now/M" },
  ])
```

</CodeGroup>

### Histogram

`histogram` groups numbers into buckets of equal width.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Search().aggs.metrics(
    bucket_name,
    A("histogram", field="price", interval=10)
)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { histogramAggregation } from "retake-search/aggregations"

Search().histogramAggregationAggregation(bucket_name, "price", 10)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Average

`avg` calculates the average of a field.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Search().aggs.metrics(
    bucket_name,
    A("avg", field="price")
)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { avgAggregation } from "retake-search/aggregations"

Search().avgAggregation(bucket_name, "price")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Sum

`sum` calculates the sum of a field.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Search().aggs.metrics(
    bucket_name,
    A("sum", field="price")
)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { sumAggregation } from "retake-search/aggregations"

Search().sumAggregation(bucket_name, "price")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Min and Max

`min` and `max` calculate the min and max of a field, respectively.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Search().aggs.metrics(
    bucket_name,
    A("min", field="price")
)

Search().aggs.metrics(
    bucket_name,
    A("max", field="price")
)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { minAggregation, maxAggregation } from "retake-search/aggregations"

Search().minAggregation(bucket_name, "price")
Search().maxAggregation(bucket_name, "price")
```

</CodeGroup>
