title: Boosting
---

## Basic Usage

Boosting is useful for cases where you want to demote certain results without excluding them. A boosting query
achieves this by returning results that match a positive query. Among these results, the ones that also match a
negative query are scored lower.

The below example returns results where `name` matches "True Crime," but the scores of results with `description` fields containing
"New York" are multiplied by `0.5`:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from retakesearch import Q

positive_query = Q("match", name="True Crime")
negative_query = Q("match", description="New York")

query = Search().query(
    Q(
        "boosting",
        positive=positive_query,
        negative=negative_query,
        negative_boost=0.5
    )
)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { boostingQuery, matchQuery } from "retake-search/helpers"

const query = Search().query(
  boostingQuery(
    matchQuery("name", "True Crime"), // Positive query
    matchQuery("description", "New York"), // Negative query
    0.5 // Negative boost
  )
)
```
