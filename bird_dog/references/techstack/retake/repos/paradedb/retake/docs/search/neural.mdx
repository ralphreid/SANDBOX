title: Hybrid/Neural Search
---

Neural search, or hybrid search, enables developers to query `keyword` or `text` fields and retrieve results that
are scored on both keyword and semantic relevance.

## Prerequisite

Before neural search can be performed over a field, the field must first be vectorized. Once vectorized,
a field does not need to be vectorized again â€” Retake ensures that vectors are properly cached and kept in sync.
By default, Retake uses `faiss`, but this setting can be [overriden](/python/index#vectorize).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
fields_to_vectorize = ["questions", "answers"]
index.vectorize(fields_to_vectorize)
```

```typescript Typescript
const fieldsToVectorize = ["questions", "answers"]
index.vectorize({ fieldNames: fieldsToVectorize })
```

</CodeGroup>

## Neural Search

The `with_neural` function takes two arguments: the query string and the field names to search over. It returns results
with the highest combined semantic and keyword-based scores:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
query = "Who am I?"
fields = ["question", "answers"]

Search().with_neural(query, fields)
```

```typescript Typescript
query = "Who am I?"
fields = ["question", "answers"]

Search().withNeural(query, fields)
```

</CodeGroup>

A more detailed overview of how neural search works and why it may be useful to your application is provided
[here](/architecture#neural-search).

## Semantic Search

If you wish to retrieve results scored purely on semantic relevance (without keyword-based relevance), the `with_semantic`
function should be used.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
query = "Who am I?"
fields = ["question", "answers"]

Search().with_semantic(query, fields)
```

```typescript Typescript
query = "Who am I?"
fields = ["question", "answers"]

Search().withSemantic(query, fields)
```

</CodeGroup>
