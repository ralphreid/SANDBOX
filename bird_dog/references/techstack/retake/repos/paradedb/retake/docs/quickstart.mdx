description: Implement hybrid search over Postgres in under five minutes
---

<Note>
  This guide will show you how to run Retake in a development environment. For
  assistance in deploying to production, please [contact our
  team](http://calendly.com/philippemnoel).
</Note>

This guide will walk you through the following steps to get started with Retake:

1. Install and run Retake
2. Upload data to Retake via Postgres integration or batch upload
3. Execute your first search

## Install and Run Retake

<Info>**Prerequisite** Docker and Docker Compose must be installed.</Info>

Clone the repo, `cd` into the `docker` folder, and run the Docker Compose file:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:getretake/retake.git
cd retake/docker
docker compose up
```

This spins up the Retake engine, which is responsible for executing search queries and storing search data.
Next, install the Retake SDK in your Python or Typescript environment.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Python
pip install retakesearch
```

```bash Typescript
npm install retake-search
```

</CodeGroup>

## Upload Data to Retake

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** Please ensure that you have [enabled logical
  replication](/setup) in your Postgres database. If you are using a
  non-Postgres data store or a Postgres service that does not support logical
  replication, you can still use Retake but will have to batch upload data using
  `Index.upsert`.
</Info>

Next, we use the Retake Python SDK to tell the Retake engine what table(s) we wish to search over. Let's pretend
we have a Postgres table called `products` with the following data:

| brand       | description                                                    | price | category |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- | -------- |
| Fratini     | Solid polyester blend wide neck womens regular top - off white | 74    | Women    |
| Zinc London | Stripes polyester sweetheart neck womens dress - black         | 849   | Women    |
| Kraus       | Wide ankle length cotton mens jeans - light blue               | 2449  | Men      |

The following code integrates this table with Retake. Note that this code block performs an expensive
reindexing operation and only needs to be run once as long as the Docker Compose stack is running.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from retakesearch import Client, Index, Database, Table

# When the Retake engine is run locally,
# this is the default API key/URL
client = Client(
  api_key="retake-test-key",
  url="http://localhost:8000"
)

# Provide your Postgres database credentials here
database = Database(
    host="***",
    user="***",
    password="***",
    dbname="***",
    port=5432,
)

# Provide the table name and columns you wish to search over here
columns = ["brand", "description", "price", "category"]
table_name = "products"

table = Table(
    name=table_name
    columns=columns
)

# Create an index
index_name = "products"
index = client.create_index(index_name)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { Client, Database, Table, Search } from "retake-search"

// When the Retake engine is run locally,
// this is the default API key/URL
const client = new Client("retake-test-key", "http://localhost:8000")

// Provide your Postgres database credentials here
const database = new Database({
  host: "***",
  user: "***",
  password: "***",
  dbName: "***",
  port: 5432,
})

// Provide the table name and columns you wish to search over here
const columns = ["brand", "description", "price", "category"]
const tableName = "products"
const table = new Table({
  table: tableName,
  columns: columns,
})

// Create an index
const indexName = "products"
const index = await client.createIndex(indexName)
```

</CodeGroup>

Next, we can define which fields in our index we wish to vectorize. A field must be vectorized in order
to perform semantic or hybrid search over it. You may skip this step if you only wish to perform keyword (BM25)
search over your fields.

By default, Retake uses the Sentence Transformers `all-MiniLM-L12-v2` model to vectorize a field. This setting
is [configurable](/python/index#vectorize).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
fields_to_vectorize = ["description"]
index.vectorize(fields_to_vectorize)
```

```typescript Typescript
const fieldsToVectorize = ["description"]
await index.vectorize({ fieldNames: fieldsToVectorize })
```

</CodeGroup>

Finally, let's index the Postgres table.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
# Note: Your table must have a primary key
index.add_source(database, table);
```

```typescript Typescript
// Note: Your table must have a primary key
await index.addSource(database, table)
```

</CodeGroup>

Optionally, data stored outside of Postgres can also be added to an index via batch upload.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
documents = [{"key": "value"}]
ids = ["id1"]

index.upsert(
  documents=documents,
  ids=ids
)
```

```typescript Typescript
const documents = [{ key: "value" }]
const ids = ["id1"]

index.upsert(documents, ids)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Execute a Search

Inside our application, we are ready to write and execute our first search query.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from retakesearch import Search

# This executes a full-text (BM25) search
bm25_search_query = Search().query("match", description="jeans")
response = index.search(bm25_search_query)

# This executes a hybrid keyword + semantic search
hybrid_search_query = Search().with_neural("jeans", ["description"])
response = index.search(hybrid_search_query)

print(response)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { Search } from "retake-search"
import { withNeural } from "retake-search/helpers"

// This executes a full-text (BM25) search
const bm25Query = Search().query(matchQuery("description", "jeans"))
const response = index.search(bm25Query)

// This executes a hybrid keyword + semantic search
const hybridQuery = Search().query(withNeural("jeans", ["description"]))
const response = index.search(hybridQuery)

print(response)
```

</CodeGroup>

This would print the following response (`hits` shortened for illustrative purposes):

<Accordion title="Response Object">
```json 
{
  "took": 34,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 5,
    "successful": 5,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 100,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 1.0,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "products",
        "_type": "_doc",
        "_id": "id1",
        "_score": 1.0,
        "_source": {
          "description": "Wide ankle length cotton mens jeans - light blue",
          "brand": "Fratini",
          "price": 74,
          "category": "Women"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
</Accordion>

Note that Retake's `Search` query builder is a forked version of the
[high-level OpenSearch client](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/clients/python-high-level) for Python and
[elastic-builder](https://elastic-builder.js.org/docs/) for Typescript.
Please refer to the [search guide](search/overview) for the essentials of writing search queries.

## Congrats!

You've successfully executed a neural search query over your Postgres database. To see full examples
of applications built with Retake, please refer to our [demo Flask and Nextjs apps](https://github.com/getretake/retake/tree/main/examples).
