Retake is a real-time database for AI data. By integratating your Postgres data with embedding models,
Retake enables real-time search over your database.

Documents in Retake are stored in **real-time indexes**. These indexes stay in sync with Postgres and
can be queried with keyword search, vector search, or hybrid search â€” a combination of the two.

## Why Retake

Retake is a good fit for developers that

1. Have large volumes of documents stored in Postgres that are expensive and time-consuming to reindex or re-embed
   with batch jobs.
2. Have investigated vector databases for similarity search, but also want the capabilities of traditional search
   (e.g. keyword-based search, faceting, efficient filtering, etc.).
3. Are looking for a search library "just works" without the overhead of managing a vector store,
   search engine, embedding models, and data ingestion pipelines.

## Use Cases

**LLM Applications**

Retake is the perfect solution for surfacing up-to-date, relevant database documents that can be
fed into the prompt windows of large language models (LLMs).

**Text Reconciliation**

Retake can be embedded into backends that map incoming text to the most similar match in a database. For instance, an
HR software company may want to map receipts uploaded by employees to recent transactions.

**Personalized Recommendations**

Recommendation engines that previously relied on rule-based approaches can now harness deeper semantic insights,
increasing the precision and relevance of their suggestions.

**Universal Search**

Retake's low-code SDKs radically simplify the integration of universal search in an application.

## Key Features

**Always in Sync**

Retake leverages logical-replication-based Change-Data-Capture (CDC) to integrate directly with Postgres. As data changes or new data arrives,
Retake ensures that the indexed data is kept in sync.

**Intelligent Vector Cache**

Whenever data is changed in Postgres, Retake updates the embedding/vector representation of that data behind the scenes.
Vectors are automatically cached for lightning-fast query results with semantic understanding.

**Low-Code SDK**

Retake provides intuitive search SDKs that drop into any Python or Typescript application (other languages coming soon).
The core API is just a few functions.

**Open/ElasticSearch DSL Compatible**

Retake enables developers to query with the full expressiveness of the OpenSearch DSL (domain-specific language).

**Deployable Anywhere**

Retake is deployable anywhere, from a laptop to a distributed cloud system.
