title: Search
---

The `Search` class is used to construct search queries via a logical pipeline of transformations.
Please refer to the [how to search guide](/search) for more information on how to use the `Search`
class.

## Basic Usage

```typescript Typescript
import { termQuery } from "retake-search/helpers"

const query = Search().query(termQuery("questions", "Who am I?"))
const response = index.search(query)
```

Note that the `Search` class is based on a forked version of the
[elastic-builder RequestBodyBuilder client](https://github.com/getretake/opensearch-js) and
has almost all — if not all — of the capabilities of elastic-builder.
