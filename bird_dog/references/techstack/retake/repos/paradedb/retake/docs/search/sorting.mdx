## By Relevance

The response object of each search result contains a `_score` attribute. Higher scores represent results that
are more relevant to the search query. By default, results are returned in descending order of `_score`.

## Custom Sorting

The `sort` function also accepts field names for custom sorting. Multiple criteria can be provided,
and the results will be sorted in order of the provided criteria.

```python Python
Search()
    .query("term", questions="Who am I?")
    .sort(
        "questions", # Ascending order
        "-answers" # Descending order
    )
```

```typescript Typescript
import { termQuery, sort } from "retake-search/helpers"

Search()
  .query(termQuery("questions", "Who am I?"))
  .sort(sort("questions", "asc"))
  .sort(sort("answers", "desc"))
```
