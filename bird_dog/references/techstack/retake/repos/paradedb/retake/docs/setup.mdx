Retake leverages PostgreSQL [logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication.html) to
detect changes in the database and propagate them to Retake. Integrating your Postgres with Retake is a good
idea if you have fast-changing data and want to reduce the latency and compute cost of reindexing or re-embedding
your data.

## Before You Begin

The following Postgres databases are real-time compatible:

1. Amazon RDS/Aurora
2. Azure DB
3. Google Cloud SQL
4. Self-Hosted Postgres

The following databases are not compatible:

1. Neon
2. Supabase
3. Any managed Postgres service that does not have logical replication or does not grant you superuser privileges

<Note>
  Note that, if you are using a data store not real-time compatible, you can
  still use Retake. Retake enables you to write your own data ingestion logic
  and you may skip this section.

## Cloud Postgres

Please click on the links below for enabling logical replication:

- [Amazon Aurora/RDS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.html)
- [Azure DB](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/postgresql/single-server/concepts-logical#set-up-your-server)
- [Google Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/replication/configure-logical-replication#configuring-your-postgresql-instance)

## Self-Hosted Postgres

If you are self-hosting Postgres, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that your Postgres user is a superuser.

```sql
SELECT usename FROM pg_user WHERE usesuper = true;
```

2. Enable logical decoding in `postgresql.conf`.

```bash
wal_level = logical
```

3. In the same `postgresql.conf` file, add replication slots.
   You must have at least as many replication slots as the number of tables you wish to search over.

```bash
max_replication_slots = 10
```

4. Restart the database. Confirm that your changes were successful by running the following command and verifying that
   the output is `logical`.

```sql
SHOW wal_level;
```
