## Data

### Document

In Retake, a document is a basic unit of information that can be indexed. It's a structured JSON object
containing information that represents the data of a single entity. A search in Retake returns a list of
relevant documents.

### Field

Each document consists of fields, which can be likened to columns in a database table, or keys of a JSON
object.

### Index

An index is a collection of documents. Typically, developers will choose to group similar documents under
a single index. A search in Retake is performed over a single index.

## Search

### Keyword-Based Search

Keyword-based search, using the BM25 algorithm, is a statistical approach to ranking search results based on
term frequency and inverse document frequency. It calculates a score for each document that reflects how often a
query term appears, considering the frequency of that term in the entire collection of documents.

Keyword-based search is especially useful for retrieving search results based on names, proper nouns, and specific terms.

### Semantic Search

Semantic search utilizes [embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings) to understand
the context and intent behind a user's search query, rather than merely matching keywords.

### Neural Search

Neural search is a technique for delivering more accurate, contextually-aware search results by merging semantic search
with keyword-based search.

Retake's neural search feature is powered by the [OpenSearch neural search plugin](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/search-plugins/neural-search/).
When the developer [executes a neural search](/search/neural), Retake triggers a process that calculates both a "keyword-based score" and a
"semantic score" before returning the results with the highest combined score.
