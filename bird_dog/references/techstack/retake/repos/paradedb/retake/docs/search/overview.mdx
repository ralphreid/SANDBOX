The `Search` class is used to construct search requests. Behind the scenes, Retake translates `Search` requests
to OpenSearch's query language (DSL). `Search` is designed with three main objectives:

1. **Composability**: Complex requests are composed by mixing and matching various components — queries,
   boolean logic, filters, aggregation, etc. — with one another.

2. **Readability**: Requests are constructed as a logical pipeline of transformations.

3. **Full OpenSearch Functionality**: `Search` supports the entire OpenSearch DSL, which is identical to
   the ElasticSearch DSL except in rare cases. Most queries, no matter how complex, are possible.

## Basic Usage

The `Index.search` function is responsible for executing queries constructed with `Search`.

This example performs a keyword search for all rows in the Postgres table `faqs` where
the column `question` matches the phrase "Who Am I?".

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from retakesearch import Client, Search

client = Client(
  api_key="retake-test-key",
  url="http://localhost:8000"
)

# Use client.create_index if the index doesn't exist
index = client.get_index("my_index")

# Construct query
query = Search().query("match", questions="Who am I?")

# Execute query
response = index.search(query)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { Client, Search } from "retake-search"
import { matchQuery } from "retake-search/helpers"

const client = new Client("retake-test-key", "http://localhost:8000")

// Use client.createIndex if the index doesn't exist
const index = await client.getIndex("my_index")

// Construct query
const query = Search().query(matchQuery("questions", "Who am I?"))

// Execute query
const response = index.search(query)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Query Construction

Complex search logic like filters, ranking, faceting, pagination, etc. can be added to the `Search` class
as a logical pipeline of transformations. For example:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
query = (
    Search()
    .query("match", questions="Who am I?")
    .filter("term", answers="Michael")
    .sort("-answers")
)

response = index.search(query)
```

```typescript Typescript
import { matchQuery, termQuery, sort } from "retake-search/helpers"

const query = Search()
  .boolQuery()
  .must(matchQuery("questions", "Who am I?"))
  .filter(termQuery("answers", "Michael))
  .sort(sort("answers", "desc"))
```

</CodeGroup>

## Field Types

Index fields have types, which are used to tell the search layer how to index the field and what kinds of search operations
are allowed on the field. If no field type is set when data is uploaded, Retake will infer and dynamically assign a field
type. But in many cases, developers will want to specify a field type themselves.

### Setting a Field Type

The `transform` property of the `Table` class has functionality to specify what field type each column should map to:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
table = Table(
    name="tv_shows",
    columns=["description", "rating"],
    transform={
      "mapping": {
        "description": "text",
        "rating": "double"
      }
    }
)
```

</CodeGroup>

`Index.create_field`also enables developers to create a field with a certain type. Note that once a field is created, its
type cannot be changed.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
index.create_field("description", "text")
```

</CodeGroup>

### Choosing a Field Type

`text` and `keyword` are two common field types . Text fields are typically used for longer pieces of text, whereas
keyword fields are typically used for individual words or phrases for the purpose of exact matching or filtering. Text fields
should be queried with the `match` operator, whereas keyword fields are queried with the `term` operator.

In addition, Retake supports a [wide variety of other field types](https://github.com/getretake/retake/blob/fb43fd2eb09f54218907876a88452e7e9974cdd1/core/search/index_mappings.py#L4).
