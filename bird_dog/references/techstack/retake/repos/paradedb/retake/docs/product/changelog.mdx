### August 8, 2023

**Vector Store and ANN Search**

The Python client now supports the creation of `knn_vector` fields which store vectors that can be retrieved
via approximate nearest neighbors search and filtered efficiently. Additionally, developers now have the capability to
choose between `faiss`, `lucene` and `nmslib` engines.

### August 5, 2023

**Real-Time Sync with Postgres**

We've retired Kafka and introduced pgsync, which synchronizes indices with Postgres tables. Unlike Kafka, pgsync is a
significantly more lightweight library that works out of the box without the need for extensive custom configuration.

### August 1, 2023

**Typescript Client Released**

Retake now works with Typescript! A convenient React hook has been
built as well.

### July 30, 2023

**Pure Semantic Search Functionality**

Introducing a new `with_semantic` function that returns results from a pure
vector-based search.

### July 26, 2023

**Search Across Multiple Tables**

After talking to our first few users, we realized that we needed to enable
search across multiple tables (for instance, tables connected by a JOIN statement). We have modified the Python client
so that developers can connect multiple tables to a single search index.

**Working Search MVP**

We're excited to release our first MVP into the wild! It's very simple: just a Python SDK
with two functions: one to index a Postgres table, and another to execute search queries with the full expressiveness
of the Open/ElasticSearch DSL. We also built an example Python Flask app using our Python library and search engine.
