title: Search
---

The `Search` class is used to construct search queries via a logical pipeline of transformations.
Please refer to the [how to search guide](/search) for more information on how to use the `Search`
class.

## Basic Usage

```python Python
from retakesearch import Search

query = Search().query("match", questions="Who am I?")
response = index.search(query)
```

Note that the `Search` class is based on a forked version of the
[Opensearch Python client](https://github.com/getretake/opensearch-py) `Search` class and
has almost all — if not all — of the capabilities of the Opensearch `Search` class.
