title: Vector Search
---

<Note>Only the Python client supports vector storage and vector search.</Note>

Vector search enables developers to search for relevant documents using a query vector.

## Prerequisite

Vector search can only be performed over fields with a `knn_vector` type, which must be
[specified by the user](/python/index#create_field).

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
index.create_field(
    field_name="my_vector_field",
    field_type="knn_vector",
    dimension=3,
    engine="faiss",
    space_type="l2"
)
```

</CodeGroup>

After the field is created, vectors can be manually upserted:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
documents = [{"my_vector_field": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3]}]
ids = ["id1"]

index.upsert(documents=documents, ids=ids)
```

</CodeGroup>

## Basic Usage

`with_nearest_neighbor` retrieves the top `k` documents whose vectors are most similar to the provided query vector.
Note that `k` has a maximum size of 10,000.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
k = 50

Search().with_nearest_neighbor(
    vector=[0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
    field="my_vector_field",
    k=k
)[0:k]
```

</CodeGroup>

## Efficient Filtering

To efficently filter results during the kNN search, as opposed to before or after the search, the `filter` argument
can be provided. This ensures that `k` results are returned, assuming that there are at least `k` results
in total. Note that efficient filtering is only supported by `lucene` and `faiss`.

```python Python
from retakesearch import Q

k = 50

Search().with_nearest_neighbor(
    vector=[0.2, 0.3, 0.4],
    field="my_vector_field",
    k=k,
    filter=Q("match", another_field="value")
)[0:k]
```
