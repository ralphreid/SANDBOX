title: How Retake Works
description: An overview of Retake's architecture

## Overview

Retake is composed of three components:

1. **Search Layer**: Responsible for processing search queries and storing data
2. **Connection Layer**: Responsible for connecting to Postgres, indexing Postgres data, and delivering incremental updates
   to the search layer
3. **Query Layer**: An SDK that plugs into the developer's application and enables developers to query the search layer

## Search Layer

Retake's search layer is built on top of [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/), an open-source fork of ElasticSearch
that acts as both a search engine and data store. The search layer is primarily responsible for

1. Receiving, indexing, and storing Postgres data from the connection layer
2. Receives user queries from the query layer, executing them, and returning search results

## Connection Layer

Retake employs logical-replication-based Change-Data-Capture (CDC) to pipe data from Postgres to the search layer. When a row is changed or new data arrives in Postgres, Retake automatically updates
the corresponding data in the search layer.

## Query Layer

The query layer is a Python SDK that connects the developer's application to the search engine. The `Search` class
of the SDK is responsible for constructing queries, which are translated to [OpenSearch query DSL](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/)
before being sent to the search engine.
