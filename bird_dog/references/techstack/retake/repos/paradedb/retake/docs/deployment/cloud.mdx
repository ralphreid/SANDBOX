title: On a Cloud Instance
---

Retake can be self-hosted inside your own cloud. This is especially useful for applications with sensitive data,
as it ensures that the information remains within your cloud infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

1. You have deployed a Linux Ubuntu virtual machine
2. Your instance has at least 8GB RAM and 16GB of storage
3. There is a **DNS A** record configured and pointing to your instance using the domain you want to use to connect to Retake.
   Alternatively, you may skip the domain and the script will default to `localhost` and setup self-signed certificates. Make sure you understand the security implications.
4. Port `80` and `443` are open. Port `80` is used by the proxy server to automatically setup HTTPS on your domain
5. Your instance has the `vm.max_map_count` setting set to at least `262144` as
   recommended by the [OpenSearch documentation](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/index/#important-settings).

## Deployment

SSH into your instance and run:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getretake/retake/main/deploy.sh
```

This will download the deploy script. Read through and make sure you understand what it does before running it. Next, run the deploy script:

```bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

The deploy script will guide you through the process of configuring and running Retake. It will automatically create a `.env`
file that contains the api key used to authenticate with the Retake API.
