title: Keyword Search

<Note>
  The code provided in this section and all subsequent sections is for query
  construction only. For a query to be executed, it must be passed into
  `Index.search`. See [Overview](/search/overview) for instructions.
</Note>

## Basic Usage

The `query` function performs keyword (BM25) search. Use the `term` operator for exact matches
and the `match` operator for full-text queries. For instance, the `term` operator on "Who am I?" will
return documents containing the exact phrase "Who am I?", whereas the `match` operator will return
documents containing "Who", "am", or "I":

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Search().query("term", questions="Who am I?")
```

```typescript Typescript
import { termQuery } from "retake-search/helpers"

Search().query(termQuery("questions", "Who am I?"))
```

</CodeGroup>

## Multiple Fields

The `multi_match` operator enables search for a term in multiple fields. This example searches
for matches in both the `question` and `answer` fields of an index:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Search().query("multi_match", query="Who am I", fields=["questions", "answers"])
```

```typescript Typescript
import { multiMatchQuery } from "retake-search/helpers"

Search().query(multiMatchQuery(["questions", "answers"], "Who am I?"))
```

</CodeGroup>

## Fuzzy Matching

The `fuzzy` operator enables fuzzy search. The following query searches for matches for a query
and allows for up to two character changes:

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
Search().query("fuzzy", questions={"value": "Whom I?", "fuzziness": 2})
```

```typescript Typescript
import { fuzzyQuery } from "retake-search/helpers"

Search().query(fuzzyQuery("questions", "Who am I?").fuzziness(2))
```

</CodeGroup>

## Boolean Queries

Boolean queries provide a flexible way to construct complex queries using four types of operators: `must`, `must_not`, `should`, and `filter`.

- `must`: The equivalent of logical AND, the `must` operator stipulates that all conditions within this clause must be satisfied for a document to match the query.

- `must_not`: The opposite of `must`, the `must_not` operator ensures that no conditions within this clause are present in any of the matching documents.

- `should`: Analogous to logical OR, the `should` operator specifies conditions that, if met, increase the relevance score of the matches. It's not mandatory for a document to meet should conditions to match the query, but it helps in scoring.

- `filter`: The filter `operator` works similar to `must` but doesn't affect the scoring. It simply includes/excludes documents based on whether they match the filter condition.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from retakesearch import Q

Search().query(
    Q(
        "bool",
        must=[Q("match", questions="Who am I?")],
        filter=[Q("term", answers="Michael")],
        must_not=[Q("term", questions="Where are you?")],
        should=[Q("match", questions="Whom are you?")]
    )
)

```

```typescript Typescript
import { matchQuery, termQuery } from "retake-search/helpers"

const query = Search()
  .boolQuery()
  .must(matchQuery("questions", "Who am I?"))
  .filter(termQuery("answers", "Michael"))
  .mustNot(termQuery("answers", "Michael"))
  .should(matchQuery("questions", "Whom are you?"))
```
