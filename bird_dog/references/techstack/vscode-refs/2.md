# Debug containerized apps

In this article

The Docker extension provides more support for debugging applications within Docker containers, such as scaffolding `launch.json` configurations for attaching a debugger to applications running within a container.

The Docker extension provides a `docker` debug configuration provider that manages how VS Code will launch an application and/or attach a debugger to the application in a running Docker container. This provider is configured via entries within `launch.json`, with configuration being specific to each application platform supported by the provider.

The Docker extension currently supports debugging [Node.js][1], [Python][2], and [.NET][3] applications within Docker containers.

Scaffolding or pasting a launch configuration into `launch.json` is **not sufficient** to build and debug a Docker container. To successfully run a Docker launch configuration, you must have:

* A Dockerfile.
* `docker-build` and `docker-run` tasks in `tasks.json`.
* A launch configuration that invokes these tasks.

We recommend using the **Docker: Add Docker Files to Workspace...** command to create these items, if none of these assets already exist. If you already have a functional Dockerfile, we recommend using the **Docker: Initialize for Docker debugging** command to scaffold a launch configuration and Docker-related tasks.

More information about debugging Node.js applications within Docker containers can be found at [Debug Node.js within a container][4].

Example `launch.json` configuration for debugging a Node.js application:
   
   
    {
      "configurations": [
        {
          "name": "Docker Node.js Launch",
          "type": "docker",
          "request": "launch",
          "preLaunchTask": "docker-run: debug",
          "platform": "node"
        }
      ]
    }
   

More information about debugging Python applications within Docker containers can be found at [Debug Python within a container][5].

Example `launch.json` configuration for debugging a Python application:
   
   
    {
      "configurations": [
        {
          "name": "Docker: Python - Django",
          "type": "docker",
          "request": "launch",
          "preLaunchTask": "docker-run: debug",
          "python": {
            "pathMappings": [
              {
                "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}",
                "remoteRoot": "/app"
              }
            ],
            "projectType": "django"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
   

You can choose between two ways of building and debugging your project within Docker containers:

* **With .NET SDK**: If you are familiar with `MSBuild` or want to containerize your project without a Dockerfile, this is the recommended choice.

> **Note**: This option is only available for .NET SDK 7 and above and uses the `dotnet publish` command to build the image.

* **With a Dockerfile**: If you prefer customizing your project with a `Dockerfile`, choose this option.

For more details about these two options, refer to [Debug .NET within Docker containers][6].

Example `launch.json` configuration for debugging a .NET application using `Dockerfile`:
   
   
    {
      "version": "0.2.0",
      "configurations": [
        {
          "name": "Launch .NET Core in Docker",
          "type": "docker",
          "request": "launch",
          "preLaunchTask": "Run Docker Container",
          "netCore": {
            "appProject": "${workspaceFolder}/project.csproj"
          }
        }
      ]
    }

### [node object properties][8]
