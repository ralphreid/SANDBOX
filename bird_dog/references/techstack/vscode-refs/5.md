In my company (\<https://indy.fr\>), we use Docker and Docker Compose to run our Node.js services locally. Recently, I needed to configure and run the VSCode debugger on some of these services to debug a feature. There are a few things to know to achieve this, which I will share in this article with some basic examples.

Before we start, here are the points that will serve as a guideline in this tutorial:

* We want to keep using Docker and Docker compose to run our services, so that we have the proper environment for each of these services (environment variables, etc).
* We do not want to touch the current `docker-compose.yml` which could, potentially, be used in the future to deploy our services in production.

##  [][4] The Sample Application

Let's start by creating a first service. It is a simple web server that concatenates two strings, a first name and a last name, and returns the result. This service will live in a `webapp/` directory at the root of the project.

###  [][5] The Node.JS code

_webapp/package.json_ 

   
   
    {
        "name": "webapp",
        "scripts": {
            "start": "node src/server.js"
        },
        "dependencies": {
            "express": "^4.16.1"
        }
    }
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

_webapp/src/server.js_ 

   
   
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
   
    app.get('/fullname', (req, res) =\> {
        const firstName = req.query.firstNme;
        const lastName = req.query.lastName;
        res.send(`${firstName} ${lastName}`);
    });
   
    app.listen(8080, () =\> console.log('Listening on port 8080...'));
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

_webapp/Dockerfile_ 

   
   
    FROM node:16
   
    WORKDIR /usr/src/app
   
    COPY package*.json ./
   
    RUN npm install
    COPY . .
   
    EXPOSE 8080
    CMD [ "node", "src/server.js" ]
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

_webapp/.dockerignore_ 

   
   
    node_modules
    npm-debug.log
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

###  [][6] The Docker configuration

Now that the application code is written and the `Dockerfile` created, we can add a `docker-compose.yml` file at the root of the project.

_docker-compose.yml_ 

   
   
    services:
        webapp:
            build: ./webapp
            ports:
                - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Let's start the service. 

   
   
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

If you go to [http://localhost:8080/fullname?firstName=Foo&lastName=Bar][7], you should see the string `undefined Bar`, which is the unexpected behavior we will debug.

##  [][8] Debugging the Application in Docker with VSCode

###  [][9] The debugger command

To allow the future VSCode debugger to attach to the Node service, we need to specify it when we start the process by adding the `\--inpect` flag.

> Simply using `\--inspect` or `\--inspect=127.0.0.1:9229` is not sufficient here because we need the `9229` port to be accessible from outside the service, which is allowed by the `0.0.0.0` address. So this command should only be used when you run the debugger in a Docker service. Otherwise, you would expose the port and the debugger to anyone on the Internet.

_webapp/package.json_ 

   
   
    {
        "name": "webapp",
        "scripts": {
            "start": "node src/server.js",
            "start:docker:debug": "node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9229 src/server.js"
        },
        "dependencies": {
            "express": "^4.16.1"
        }
    }
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

###  [][6] The Docker configuration

Following our guideline, we do not modify the initial `docker-compose.yml` but create a second one that extends the first one. We will use the [`-f` flag][10] of the `docker-compose` CLI to use them both.

_docker-compose.debug.yml_ 

   
   
    services:
        webapp:
            command: [ 'npm', 'run', 'start:docker:debug' ]
            ports:
                - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
                - "127.0.0.1:9229:9229"
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Then, to restart the service with debug mode enabled, you can use this command: 

   
   
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.debug.yml up -d
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

The service is now ready to be attached to the VSCode debugger.

###  [][11] Running the debugger with VSCode

At the root of your project, create a new directory `.vscode` and add the following configuration file.

_.vscode/launch.json_ 

   
   
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "type": "node",
                "request": "attach",
                "name": "Debug webapp",
                "remoteRoot": "/app/src",
                "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/webapp/src"
            }
        ]
    }
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

When adding a breakpoint, the `remoteRoot` and `localRoot` properties will match the file's position in the VSCode environment and its location in the Docker service file system.

You can now start the debugger on the `webapp` service. Open the debugging panel and select the `Debug webapp` option. Then click on the play button.

![start-debugger.png][12]

The debugger is started.

![add-breakpoint.png][13]

Add a breakpoint on line 6 and then go to [http://localhost:8080/fullname?firstName=Foo&lastName=Bar][7].

![run-debugger.png][14]

The debugger stops on line 6 and we can see that the variable `firstName` is `undefined`. The problem comes from line 5 where this is a typo on the `firstName` parameter name.

To close the debugger, click on the button with a red square.

##  [][15] Debugging Multiple Docker Services

###  [][16] The Node.JS micro-service

To take this a step further, we will add another service, named `micro-service`, which will be called by `webapp`.

First, copy and paste the contents of the `webapp` directory into another directory named `micro-service`.

Then, in the `webapp` directory, install `axios` and update the code as follows. 

   
   
    npm install axios
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

_webapp/src/server.js_ 

   
   
    const express = require('express');
    const axios = require('axios');
   
    const app = express();
   
    app.get('/fullname', async (req, res, next) =\> {
        try {
            const { data: fullName } = await axios.get('http://micro-service:8080/fullname', {
                params: req.query
            });
            res.send(fullName);
        } catch (err) {
            next(err);
        }
    });
   
    app.listen(8080, () =\> console.log('Listening on port 8080...'));
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

> The URL used line 8 is based on the name of the Docker service defined in the next section.

###  [][6] The Docker configuration

Add the new service to your `docker-compose.yml`. Note that it uses a different port so as not to conflict with the `webapp` service.

_docker-compose.yml_ 

   
   
    services:
        webapp:
            build: ./webapp
            ports:
                - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
        micro-service:
            build: ./micro-service
            ports:
                - "127.0.0.1:3001:8080"
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Then, in your `docker-compose.debug.yml`, add the new service as well. Note that the debugger port is also different from the first one.

_docker-compose.debug.yml_ 

   
   
    services:
        webapp:
            command: [ 'npm', 'run', 'start:docker:debug' ]
            ports:
                - "127.0.0.1:8080:8080"
                - "127.0.0.1:9229:9229"
        micro-service:
            command: [ 'npm', 'run', 'start:docker:debug' ]
            ports:
                - "127.0.0.1:3001:8080"
                - "127.0.0.1:9230:9229"
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Now build and start the two services. 

   
   
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.debug.yml up -d
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

###  [][17] Running multiple debuggers with VSCode

The last thing to do is to add the configuration of the second debugger in `launch.json`.

_.vscode/launch.json_ 

   
   
    {
        "version": "0.2.0",
        "configurations": [
            {
                "type": "node",
                "request": "attach",
                "name": "Debug webapp",
                "remoteRoot": "/app/src",
                "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/webapp/src"
            },
            {
                "type": "node",
                "request": "attach",
                "name": "Debug micro-service",
                "port": 9230,
                "remoteRoot": "/app/src",
                "localRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/micro-service/src"
            }
        ]
    }
   

Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode

Once the configuration is added, you can run the two debuggers for each service.

![start-webapp-debugger.png][18]

![start-micro-service-debugger.png][19]

Once both debuggers are started, add a breakpoint in each service and go to [http://localhost:8080/fullname?firstName=Foo&lastName=Bar][7]. The application will stop successively on each breakpoint.

Your VSCode debugger is now fully configured to work with your Docker services. Congratulations!
