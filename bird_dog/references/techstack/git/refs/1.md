# Oh Shit, Git!?!

![ads via Carbon][1][4 Quick Questions - Please help us improve the Network, and the advertisers who run on it.][2][ads via Carbon][3]

Git is hard: screwing up is easy, and figuring out how to fix your mistakes is fucking impossible. Git documentation has this chicken and egg problem where you can't search for how to get yourself out of a mess, _unless you already know the name of the thing you need to know about_ in order to fix your problem.

So here are some bad situations I've gotten myself into, and how I eventually got myself out of them _in plain english_.
   
   
    git reflog
   
   
   
   
    git reset HEAD@{index}
   

You can use this to get back stuff you accidentally deleted, or just to remove some stuff you tried that broke the repo, or to recover after a bad merge, or just to go back to a time when things actually worked. I use `reflog` A LOT. Mega hat tip to the many many many many many people who suggested adding it!
   
   
    git add . # or add individual files
    git commit --amend --no-edit
   
   

This usually happens to me if I commit, then run tests/linters... and FML, I didn't put a space after an equals sign. You could also make the change as a new commit and then do `rebase -i` in order to squash them both together, but this is about a million times faster.

_Warning: You should never amend commits that have been pushed up to a public/shared branch! Only amend commits that only exist in your local copy or you're gonna have a bad time._
   
   
    git commit --amend
   

Stupid commit message formatting requirements.
   
   
    git branch some-new-branch-name
   
    git reset HEAD~ --hard
    git checkout some-new-branch-name
   

Note: this doesn't work if you've already pushed the commit to a public/shared branch, and if you tried other things first, you might need to `git reset HEAD@{number-of-commits-back}` instead of `HEAD~`. Infinite sadness. Also, many many many people suggested an awesome way to make this shorter that I didn't know myself. Thank you all!
   
   
    git reset HEAD~ --soft
    git stash
   
    git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
    git stash pop
    git add . # or add individual files
    git commit -m "your message here";
   

A lot of people have suggested using `cherry-pick` for this situation too, so take your pick on whatever one makes the most sense to you!
   
   
    git checkout name-of-the-correct-branch
   
    git cherry-pick master
   
    git checkout master
    git reset HEAD~ --hard

If you know that you made changes to files, but `diff` is empty, you probably `add`-ed your files to staging and you need to use a special flag.
   
   
    git diff --staged

File under ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ (yes, I know this is a feature, not a bug, but it's fucking baffling and non-obvious the first time it happens to you!)
   
   
    git log
   
   
    git revert [saved hash]
   
   
   

Turns out you don't have to track down and copy-paste the old file contents into the existing file in order to undo changes! If you committed a bug, you can undo the commit all in one go with `revert`.

You can also revert a single file instead of a full commit! But of course, in true git fashion, it's a completely different set of fucking commands...
   
   
    git log
   
   
    git checkout [saved hash] -- path/to/file
   
    git commit -m "Wow, you don't have to copy-paste to undo"

When I finally figured this out it was HUGE. HUGE. H-U-G-E. But seriously though, on what fucking planet does `checkout --` make sense as the best way to undo a file? :shakes-fist-at-linus-torvalds:
   
   
    cd ..
    sudo rm -r fucking-git-repo-dir
    git clone https://some.github.url/fucking-git-repo-dir.git
    cd fucking-git-repo-dir

Thanks to Eric V. for this one. All complaints about the use of `sudo` in this joke can be directed to him.

For real though, if your branch is sooo borked that you need to reset the state of your repo to be the same as the remote repo in a "git-approved" way, try this, but beware these are destructive and unrecoverable actions!
   
   
    git fetch origin
    git checkout master
    git reset --hard origin/master
   
    git clean -d --force
   

*Disclaimer: This site is not intended to be an exhaustive reference. And yes, there are other ways to do these same things with more theoretical purity or whatever, but I've come to these steps through trial and error and lots of swearing and table flipping, and I had this crazy idea to share them with a healthy dose of levity and profanity. Take it or leave it as you will!
